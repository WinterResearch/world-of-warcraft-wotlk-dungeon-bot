please consider giving repositorty a star if you enjoy :)

a world of warcraft pixel bot aimed at botting dungeons.

this program was built specifically for paladin, though can be modified to work for other classes with relative ease.

yes the code is sloppy, but its a proof of concept for botting dungeons with relative ease.

put script in same folder as the images. likely may need to retake these images as they are sensitive to specific monitors.
reference python file, find/replace all png pictures that are being used within script. (windows+shift+s to take screenshot, save over same picture).

install weakauaras addon, one by one, import all of the weakauras strings from weakauras.txt file, each separated by spaces.

required settings:
  /follow macro, edit to dps that your character will be following, for each dungeon
  macro keybind = Alt5
  
  keybinds / targeting:
    interact With Target: CTRL-6
    assist Target: F1
    attack Target: F2
  interface / Controls:
    interact on left click
